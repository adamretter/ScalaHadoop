 * See the Hint on page 236 of the O'Reilly book "Hadoop, The Definitive Guide (3rd-edition)"
 * and study the code of the Hadoop class, particularly the deserialize(org.apache.hadoop.io.Writable) method
 *
 * The Hadoop approach is Mutable
 * which is somewhat at odd's with what we are doing here in Scala
 * and can sometimes lead to head scratching issues!
 *
 * This class implements an Immutable version of the deserializer which
 * never re-uses objects, but rather creates new objects
 * each time.
